MyArea- An E-commerce Platform For Online Shopping With Usersâ€™ Choice Grocery Shop
This project was based on a E-Commerce website. And this E-commerce website will give a solution of real life problem. In real life, whenever we need something daily necessary product. Then, you need to go outside and find any local shop in your territory and you choose the local shop to buy that product. Like this example, we wanted to bring that idea in our platform. Whenever you visit that website you will find lots of local shop name which, are located in your area and you will choose a local shop to buy your necessary product. You will visit a shop and search for your desirable product. In this project we have used a map API(Application programming Interface) to find the the user location and based on the user location this website will try to provide the nearest shop.
